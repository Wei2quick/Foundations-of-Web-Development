        it was all text on the webpage, sight a few images, which we would click with the mouse to get to the content. It was kind of like reading newspapers and magazines, just with a bit more contents. The navigation was a bit confusing (or computers in general), that we would close the browser and reopen it to get to the content on the same website, if we were “lost” and couldn’t find our way back to the main page. Back button, refresh button were magic to us and we were so scared just to use them too often, feeling it was like reusing a physical object which would eventually wear out and the computer will break down.
