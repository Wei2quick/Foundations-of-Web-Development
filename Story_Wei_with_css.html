  <p>
    <span class="bold"> I was fourth grade and received an assignment to write a paper on our national poet.</span>
    Until then there was quite a rule on only using books and going to the almost inexistent library for school work.
  </p>

  <p>
    A classmate who made a comprehensive paper told me she found the info on <a href="google.com">google</a>. So I go home and tell my parents to let me use the internet for school.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was frustrating because it is about a Romanian poet, and the information is scarce so it was hard to find what I was looking for. Furthermore, I always found the modem to be incredibly unaesthetic. I never shared that thought though because I thought the benefit of having internet access outweighed the visual handicap.
  </p>

  <p>
    I considerably improved my English by reading tech and science articles on Yahoo starting with the age of 10-11. I read more than a handful a day and remember at that time 
    <span class="italic">wanted to design devices myself.</span>

    <span class="bold">My first experience using the internet is most likely a relatable one.</span> I was in school, in Paris, and the teacher brought the entire class up to the computer room. I can't remember if the computers were just installed or if it was just the first time we where allowed to use them but I do recall that one particular student had some previous knowledge, mainly due to the fact that he knew how to bypass the school block and was able to get us straight to the most exciting games website. I remember the walls were orange but I have not the recollection of the computer we where using or what we were supposed to be doing (most likely something less exciting like WolframAlpha or paint). Once we got onto the games website I was blown away by the number of games I could play at my will, it was like an endless supply of fun to me and I was incredibly excited. It was clear at that moment that I had underestimated the internet.
</p>

  <p>
    My mother had a Mac in the house which she mainly used to write, and I'm sure we had an internet connection at that time but I had never tried using it. To me, the computer was just a tool for work and there was nothing cool or desirable about that, I had no interest in them whatsoever. This obviously changed when I found all the games. Shooting aliens or just simple platformers... I was hooked.
  </p>

  <p>
    So that's my first real memory of using one and being excited by one. First, the thrill of being able to bypass the school block on forbidden websites then finding out that there where entire websites filled with thousands of games, my mind was blown.

  <p>  
    <span class="bold">I don't remember any remarkable first interactions with the web,</span> but I remember a time in my childhood where it was all about Bluetooth. We exchanged ringtones, cool background pictures, etc. I always got so frustrated when my Bluetooth didnâ€™t work, which was almost always. But I got such joy when it worked and I could use this new ringtone as my own as well or the new background wallpaper or just listen to the song that I received. This feeling of being able to share something with your friends was so amazing at the time. Most of the things I did on a computer were offline in the beginning as far as I can remember.

  <p>
    <span class="bold">To be honest I don't remember the first time I used the internet</span> because as I remember it always was there. Though, I remember some funny stories about how I was learning to understand what is it and how it works. So I am going to write about one of them.
  </p>

  <p>
    As I already mentioned, the Internet was existing since I was born, and when I was 5 years old I remember that my family had one super old computer, which looked like a big plastic box, and a more new version of computer, which was already quite flat. Everyone, of course, was using the new one because it was faster and better, and I, as the smallest person in the family was left to play with an old one. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Apparently, the new computer was connected to the internet and I was observing my parents searching web, so I knew everything about how it looked inside and how to use it. Well, at least I thought that I knew everything. And one day, playing around the old computer I found the icon of Internet Explorer and I was sure that this icon means that I can access the internet. And being very excited about my discovery I decided to search for something. When I clicked on it nothing happened because the computer was not connected to any network but for a moment I thought that I broke something in the computer because I was thinking that you can install the "Internet" on your computer like all the other programs. I came to my parents with this story and they explained to me that the internet is not just one program.
